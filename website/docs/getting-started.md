# Getting Started

## Dare-DB

**Dare-DB** is a project that provides an in-memory database utilizing Redis-inspired hashtables implemented in Go [here](https://github.com/dmarro89/go-redis-hashtable). It offers a lightweight and efficient solution for storing data in memory and accessing it through simple HTTP operations.



## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer an in-memory database that leverages hashtables for efficient data storage and retrieval. The Go implementation allows using this database as a component in other Go services or integrating it into applications that require rapid access to in-memory data.
