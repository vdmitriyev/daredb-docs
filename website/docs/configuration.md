# Configuration

### Configuration Concept

This document outlines a configuration concept, detailing the steps involved in the configuration process:

* Default name of the configuration file is "config.toml" 
* Configuration file should be located at the root folder of the database
* The application will create a configuration file upon initial startup, if one is not already present.
* Configuration file uses ```TOML``` format
* Configuration values should be read as follows:
    + ```<CATEGORY><CONFIGURATION>```
    + Ex. "server.host"
* Database leverages environment variables to dynamically modify settings defined in a configuration file. This process typically involves two steps:
    + **Initial Configuration Load**: During startup, the application reads the configuration file and sets configuration parameters based on the values from the file.
    + **Environment Variable Override**: The  database then checks relevant environment variables. If an environment variable with a matching name exists, its value is used to override the corresponding value loaded from the configuration file.

### Configuration Parameters and Default Values

The database should use a configuration file that will defined following parameters:

| **Configuration** | **Default** | **ENV Name** | **Description** | **Category**| **Status**|

### Internal Settings and Constants

The current section documents a hardcoded settings and constants used in the DareDB

* `JWT` token has an `expirationTime` of a token set to `50 minutes`. After this period, a new  JWT token must be requested.
